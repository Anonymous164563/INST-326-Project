By utilizing the following library 
"Mathplotlib(Enables for sin, cos, compatibility)
SymPy(Creates symbolic math schema)
Ttk(Creates the usable interface)"
The application will have only two functions, 5 total. One to do the displaying of the interface(buttons, tabs, etc.). T
he other will do the calculations. We call the functions graph_Display and graph_Calculations, respectively. 
We have the function evaluate expression, and look into the expressions. 
Within the function called graph_Calculations, the algorithms for calculating the various graphs were implemented. 
Here, the library for calculating these graphs was the SymPy library. The keyword used here was sym. 
Wherever you see sym was where the library for SysSym and its various functions was implemented. 
The calc_value function examines the values entered in the box that stores the expression in x to determine whether it should be calculated or displayed in the graph.
